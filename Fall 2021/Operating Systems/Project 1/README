  4.2/4.3 (pstat operates within my understanding of the requirements and returns the pid, ticks, and queue of all process)
  4.4 (a queue is implemented into the proc structure in the form of an int variable holding the queue level of the running process and the scheduler running through a series of for loops that only run if the level above is not running a process)
  4.5 (when a process is set to runnable it's status in the queue is evaluated as well as its ticks to allow the process to be moved down in the queue)
  4.6 (within the yield() function inside of proc.c  a check is made against a tick counter to reset all processes to the top of the queue)
