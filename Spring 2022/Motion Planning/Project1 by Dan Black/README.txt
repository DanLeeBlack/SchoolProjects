Project1 for Com S 476
Author: Dan Black

Project performs 1 of 3 search algorithms on a set of input parameters.

to run program from CMD type:
"python Project1 'description.json' 'alg'"

-'description.json'is the file location of the json file holding the formated problem description
-'alg' is the desired algorithm typed as DFS, BFS, or Astar

There are cmd errors shown in the event xI is outside of G, if 'alg' is not an acceptable format, or if the algorithm fails to acheive a solution.

If a solution is found it will be put in a json file writen as "project1_dfs.json", "project1_bfs.json", or "project1_astar.json" depending on the algorithm used
